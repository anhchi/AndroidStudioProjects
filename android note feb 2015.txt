WindowDecorActionBar

onCreate function, if there is codeline requestWindowFeature(), make sure its above super.onCreate code line

setContentView is used before checking things on the view

if problem with hiding action bar, need to add requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_ACTION_BAR) before calling getSupportActionBar() (notice that getActionBar() may get error, suggest to use getSupportActionBar())

First, you cannot use android.widget.ShareActionProvider with the appcompat-v7 action bar backport (e.g., ActionBarActivity). Either use the appcompat-v7 version of ShareActionProvider, or move everything over to the native action bar.

Second, if you stick with appcompat-v7, then you cannot safely use getActionProvider(), as that method will not exist on API Level 10 and below. Replace menuItem.getActionProvider() with MenuItemCompat.getActionProvider(menuItem).
